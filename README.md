# Validation lib comparaison

[![Project license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Shuunen/validation-lib-comparison.svg?color=informational)](https://github.com/Shuunen/validation-lib-comparison/blob/master/LICENSE)

## The goal of this project

The goal is to compare different libraries and approaches to validate data in a TypeScript ecosystem.

It's interesting to see how each library is designed, how it's used, and how it performs.

Ideally you can use this comparison to choose the library that fits your needs the best.

## Run tests and benchmarks

Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.1.x then :

```bash
# install the dependencies
bun install
# run each file once just to verify that everything is working as expected
bun check:once
# run the benchmarks
bun bench
```

At the time of writing, Node 22 is around 2 times slower than Bun v1 ^^'

## The comparison results

Here are the library used in this comparison :

- [arktype](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype) from David Blass
- [valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot) from Fabian Hiller
- [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) from Colin McDonnell

Legend :

- Deps : the number of dependencies of the library
- Size : the minified build size in bytes of the related file in `src`, run  `bun run build` to see by yourself
- Light : 1 point if the build is less than 10 KB
- Input : 1 point if the library can see that `age` is optional in the input but not optional in `type User` the output type
- Throw : 1 point if the library have a parse or throw method, useful when we don't want to handle the error cases
- Safe : 1 point if the library have a safe parse method that will not throw and usually return a `Result` type
- Script exec : 1 point if the average time in milliseconds to execute the test file with bun is under `100ms`, check the `bun run bench` command output
- Lib exec : 1 point if the average time in milliseconds to execute the library is under `30ms`, check the `bun run check:once` command output
- Fast : 1 point if the library execution time is less than 100 ms
- Readability : 1 point if the library is easy to write & read, the syntax need to be intuitive

## My favorite pick

Zod is my favorite pick because it's fast and provide a better readability.

Ok the build size is bigger but it does not impact the performance that much.

The 34ms vs 10ms seems like a 3x difference but it's the time to run 1000 iterations. So in the end it's not that much of a difference in a real world scenario.

## Todo

- [ ] vanilla version ?
- [ ] check error messages
- [ ] check custom error messages
- [ ] check custom validation rules
- [ ] check the perf without using `console`

## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this project :

- Add a new library to the comparison
- Improve the comparison table, criteria, or scoring
- Improve the samples in `src`
- Find a way to enhance library isolation to have more meaningful benchmarks
- Whatever you think that could be useful, check the above todo list for inspiration

Just open an issue or a PR, I'll be happy to discuss it with you <3
